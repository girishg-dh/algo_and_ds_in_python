Statement
Given a string containing an arithmetic expression, implement a basic calculator that evaluates the expression string. The expression string can contain integer numeric values and should be able to handle the “+” and “-” operators, as well as “()” parentheses.

Constraints:

Let s be the expression string. We can assume the following constraints: 
s consists of digits, “+”, “-”, “(”, and “)”.
s represents a valid expression.
“+” is not used as a unary operation (+1 and +(2+3) +(2+3) are invalid).
“-” could be used as a unary operation (−1−1 and −(2+3) −(2+3)are valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
